        For what values of $n$ does the substring $000$ appear in $0^n$ an odd
        number of times?
    </pl-hint>
    <pl-hint show-after-submission=3>
        Consider the maximal blocks of 0s that appear in a string. For example, in
        $10001101110000100000$, the maximal blocks of 0s are
        $$1(000)11(0)111(0000)1(00000).$$
        Then, consider the number of occurrences of $000$ contributed by each block.
    </pl-hint>
    <pl-hint show-after-submission=5>
        Some of these blocks contribute an odd number of occurrences of $000$. We
        want those types of blocks to appear an even number of times.
